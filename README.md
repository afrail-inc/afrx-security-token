## AFRX Security Token ‚Äì Official Token Design

This image represents the official token design for the AFRX Security Token, issued by Afrail Inc. under the ERC-3643 standard. The design is not just symbolic ‚Äî it encapsulates the token‚Äôs core attributes of compliance, programmability, and real-world equity backing.

**üîç Token Design Breakdown:**

Central Symbol (Modified **‚Äúa‚Äù** with Tail and Square Dot)
The stylized central emblem is a unique take on the lowercase "a", referencing **Afrail Inc.** as the issuer.

The vertical tail suggests directional innovation ‚Äî **mobility** and **movement**.

The square dot beneath the tail represents **precision**, **order**, and **finality** ‚Äî hallmarks of smart contract determinism and regulatory clarity.

**Text Engraving:**

Top Arc: **AFRX SECURITY TOKEN ERC-3643**: This reinforces the token‚Äôs regulatory compliance as a tokenized security, adhering to globally recognized standards for permissioned tokens with KYC/AML layers.

Bottom Arc: **BACKED BY REAL EQUITY IN AFRAIL INC**: This line affirms that AFRX is not a utility token or speculative cryptocurrency. Each token is linked to actual equity held in Afrail Inc., providing *intrinsic value* and *real ownership*.

Side Stars (at 9 and 3 o‚Äôclock)
The symmetrical stars symbolize stability and compliance ‚Äî referencing dual oversight: one by the issuer (Afrail Inc.), the other by regulatory frameworks. Their positioning balances the circular theme, reinforcing the idea of completeness and trust.

**Gold Finish:**
The gold coloration is deliberate ‚Äî symbolizing:

- Asset-backing
- Investor-grade security
- Long-term value
  
It visually separates AFRX from typical volatile tokens by emphasizing trust, regulation, and real equity.

**üõç Purpose and Usage:**

This token design should appear in all:

- ‚úÖ Official investor materials
- ‚úÖ Product whitepapers
- ‚úÖ Regulatory filings (visual representation)
- ‚úÖ Press releases
- ‚úÖ Token dashboards or portals (where graphical representations are supported)

## üîê Section 7: Proceeds Management and Escrow Strategy

All cash proceeds from the sale of AFRX Security Tokens will be paid directly into a regulated **Escrow Account** upon commencement of token production and sale. This structure ensures:

- ‚úÖ Transparency  
- ‚úÖ Investor protection  
- ‚úÖ Regulatory and compliance assurance  

Afrail Inc. **will not have access to these funds** until a minimum capital raise threshold is met.

### üéØ Minimum Raise Requirement

To unlock funds from the escrow:

- **Target Raise:** $4.039 billion USD  
- **Minimum Threshold (10%):** $403.9 million USD  

Once 10% is raised and verified, Afrail Inc. may begin drawing down funds in accordance with an approved use-of-funds schedule.

### üèóÔ∏è Bridge Financing for Early Operations

Before reaching 10%, Afrail Inc. will pursue **short-term, low-interest loans backed by the escrow balance**, for:

- üèôÔ∏è Pre-engineering in **South Florida**  
- üåç Site preparation in **Northern Namibia**

This enables early progress while maintaining responsible financial safeguards.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of This Structure

- ‚öñÔ∏è **Investor Assurance:** No premature access to capital  
- üîê **Compliance:** Aligned with security token regulatory best practices  
- üöÄ **Readiness:** Enables engineering momentum with escrow-backed credibility
