# 7. Proceeds Management and Escrow Strategy

This section outlines how proceeds from the AFRX Security Token sale will be managed, including details on escrow custody, access requirements, and interim financing options. These structures are designed to protect investors, comply with regulatory best practices, and support pre-operational readiness for Afrail Inc.

## 7.1 Escrow-Based Custody of AFRX Proceeds

All cash proceeds from the sale of AFRX Security Tokens will be paid directly into a regulated Escrow Account upon the commencement of token production and sale. This escrow mechanism ensures:

- Transparency  
- Investor protection  
- Regulatory and compliance assurance  

Afrail Inc. will not be able to access these funds immediately upon receipt.

## 7.2 Access Contingency: Minimum Raise Threshold

Funds in escrow will remain locked until Afrail Inc. reaches a minimum raise threshold of **10% of the targeted raise amount**.

- **Target Raise:** $4.039 billion USD  
- **10% Threshold:** $403.9 million USD  

Once this threshold is reached and verified, Afrail Inc. may begin drawing down funds per agreed use-of-funds schedules and reporting requirements.

## 7.3 Bridge Financing Potential

Prior to reaching the 10% threshold, Afrail Inc. will explore short-term, low-interest loans backed by the escrowed AFRX funds to support early operations, including:

- Pre-engineering & infrastructure readiness in South Florida  
- Site preparation and engineering surveys in Northern Namibia  

These operations will help maintain momentum and readiness while ensuring financial prudence and accountability.
