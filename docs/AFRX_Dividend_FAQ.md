AFRX Security Token – Dividend Distribution FAQ

Who is eligible to receive dividends from AFRX?

All verified and registered AFRX security token holders are eligible. This excludes wallets that do not meet compliance under ERC-3643 standards.

Are dividends distributed to all AFRX investors or only specific roles?

Dividends are distributed proportionally to all eligible token holders, based on holdings. There’s no special role required beyond ERC-3643 compliance.

How often will dividends be paid out?

Dividends are paid periodically based on profits generated by Afrail Inc. and its smart mobility subsidiaries. Schedules and amounts will be announced in advance.

How are dividends distributed to token holders?

Dividends are paid in USDC (or another approved stablecoin), directly to the verified wallets of compliant holders.

Do I need to take any action to receive my dividends?

No — as long as your wallet is verified and compliant, dividends are distributed automatically through the AFRX smart contract’s claim mechanism.

What is ERC-3643 and why is it important?

ERC-3643 enforces on-chain identity verification, regulatory compliance, and jurisdictional transfer restrictions — making it ideal for secure, legal dividend payouts.
