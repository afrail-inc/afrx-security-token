# Technical Clarification: ERC-3643 vs ERC-1400

This repository includes documentation that references ERC‑3643 as being “based on” ERC‑1400.

### Clarification:

-   ERC‑3643 adopts many compliance principles originally described in ERC‑1400 — such as document linking, transfer restrictions, and identity-based permissions.
-   However, **ERC‑3643 is technically built on ERC‑20**, not on ERC‑1400 contracts.
-   This distinction is important for developers, auditors, and protocol reviewers analyzing the AFRX token’s architecture.

No changes have been made to historical whitepapers or documentation in order to preserve version integrity.
